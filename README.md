## üìù Note 
This was my first Discord bot that i made back in 2022. Since I didn‚Äôt know much back then, I used some community-made commands. Later, I made some changes, fixes, improved overall NSFW features and added new NSFW stuff. As I never had the time to fully complete it, I‚Äôm now sharing it for free for anyone to use.

If anyone from the BDFD community recognizes their code in this project, please contact me for proper credit.
This project will **not receive future updates** and will remain as it is, but if you have any questions or need help, feel free to reach out ‚Äî *I‚Äôll be happy to assist.*
