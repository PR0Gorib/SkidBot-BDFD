# SkidBot

SkidBot is an **NSFW-focused Discord bot** made using **Bot Designer for Discord (BDFD)** with some extra basic features.

---

## 🔥 Main Features
1. 🔞 NSFW commands (various categories) 
2. 🎭 Anime roleplay gifs (hug, slap, kiss, etc.)  
3. 😂 Memes & fun commands (random memes, jokes and more)
4. 🔨 Basic moderation (some commands may not work)  
5. 🎧 Music System (planned but never finished due to limitations)

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This bot contains **18+ content**. Use only in NSFW-allowed servers and by users 18+. If you're not familiar with APIs, do not mess with the code — it may break the bot or leak sensitive data.

---

## 📝 Note 
I started this project in 2022, but it was never fully finished, so it contains some community-made commands from that time.

In 2025, I returned to the project, made improvements, fixed many issues, and added a new NSFW system.
Since I didn’t have time to fully complete it, I'm now making it available for anyone to use for free

If anyone from the BDFD community recognizes their code in this project, please reach out — I’ll be happy to give you proper credit.
